Welcome to the Tailwind HTML Starter Kit repository! This project provides a simple and efficient setup for web development using Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js

## Installing Tailwind HTML Setup

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prxncxss03/tailwind-html-starter.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tailwind-html
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Using Live Server
If you have a live server set up for your project, you can open it in your browser to see your changes in real time. This is particularly useful when you’re working with HTML and CSS, as it allows you to immediately see the effects of your code.

If you’re using Visual Studio Code, there’s an extension called “Live Server” that you can use. Once installed, you can right-click on your HTML file and select “Open with Live Server”, and your default browser will open a new tab displaying your webpage.

Please note that the actual steps might vary depending on the specific live server setup you have.
